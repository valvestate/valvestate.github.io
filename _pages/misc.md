I enjoy playing and listening to (and watching) music (performances). I play several musical instruments, but I am most comfortable with the electric guitar. Here is a (not complete) list of some of my most influential (and favourite) players, in no particular order:

Jimi Hendrix, B.B. King, John Petrucci, Julian Lage, Paul Gilbert, Kirk Fletcher, Tom Misch, John Mayer, Ted Greene, Gary Moore, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, Chris Cain, Joey Landreth, Chris Buck, Mateus Asato, George Harrison, Molly Miller, Nick Johnston, ...

I also enjoy playing and watching football (the kind where you play a *ball* with *feet*). I support Liverpool FC.
