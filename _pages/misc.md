I enjoy playing and listening to (and watching) music (performances). I play several musical instruments, but I am most comfortable with the electric guitar. Here is a (not complete) list of some of my most influential (and favourite) players, in no particular order:

Jimi Hendrix, B.B. King, John Petrucci, Julian Lage, Kirk Fletcher, Tom Misch, John Mayer, Ted Greene, Gary Moore, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, Chris Cain, Joey Landreth, Chris Buck, Mateus Asato, George Harrison, ...

I also enjoy playing and watching football (the kind where you actually play a *ball* with your *feet*). I support Liverpool FC.
