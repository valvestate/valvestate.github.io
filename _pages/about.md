I'm a 4th-year DPhil/PhD student in computer science at the University of Oxford. Before coming to Oxford, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Informatics from Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, Indonesia, and a master's degree in advanced computer science from the University of Liverpool.


Research Interests
======
My current research is in the use of formal techniques for verifying and reasoning about systems composed of multiple self-interested intelligent agents. It combines approaches from formal verification, logic, automata theory, and game theory. The work is documented on EVE (Equilibrium Verification Environment) Web.
