I'm an assistant professor (or lecturer in the [traditional UK system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_in_the_United_Kingdom#Comparison)) in the [School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences.htm) and member of [LAIV: Lab for AI Verification](https://laiv.uk/) at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. Prior to joining Heriot-Watt, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with [Anthony Lin](https://anthonywlin.github.io/) at [TU Kaiserslautern](https://arg.cs.uni-kl.de/en/gruppe/najib/) in Germany. I hold a [DPhil/PhD from the University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/muhammad.najib/) (supervised by [Julian Gutierrez](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/julian-gutierrez-santiago) and [Mike Wooldridge](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/)), an MSc from the University of Liverpool, and a BSc from Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology. Additionally, I have industry experience as a R&D software engineer at Samsung Electronics in Indonesia.

**Fully-funded PhD opportunities at Heriot-Watt:** I am currently accepting applications from PhD students who are interested in working with me in my main research areas. Funding is available to cover both international tuition fees and living expenses. For more information, please visit the [PhD opportunities in Computer Science](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences/research/phd/phd-oportunities-in-computer-science.htm) page. If you have a potential project in mind, feel free to drop me an email to discuss further. I look forward to hearing from you!

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and game theory. I use formal and mathematical techniques to verify and reason about systems composed of multiple self-interested intelligent agents. In particular, I mainly work on the following topics:

+ Logic and game theory in theoretical computer science and foundations of AI.
+ Verification, design, and synthesis of equilibria in concurrent multi-agent systems.
+ Mathematical/computational logic (e.g., modal and temporal logics).
+ Model checking, automated synthesis, and formal verification.
+ Computational complexity of problems related to topics above.

I am the main developer of [**EVE** (Equilibrium Verification Environment)](https://github.com/eve-mas/eve-parity/), a tool for [*rational verification*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-021-02658-y). The tool can be used online from [http://eve.cs.ox.ac.uk](http://eve.cs.ox.ac.uk/index). I am always interested in improving EVE (e.g., faster techniques, new use cases, etc.) and welcome potential collaborations.

Supervision Interests
======
I am interested in supervising PhD/MSc/BSc students who want to work on (or related to) topics within my research interests (see Research Interests section above). If you have a potential project in mind, feel free to drop me an email to discuss further.
