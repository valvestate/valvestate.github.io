I'm an assistant professor in the [School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences.htm) at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh. Before Heriot-Watt, I was a postdoctoral researcher at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany. I hold a DPhil/PhD from the University of Oxford, an MSc from the University of Liverpool, and a BSc from Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology.

Research Interests
======
My current research is in the use of formal techniques for verifying and reasoning about systems composed of multiple self-interested intelligent agents. It combines approaches from formal verification, logic, automata theory, and game theory. The work is documented on [EVE (Equilibrium Verification Environment) Web](http://eve.cs.ox.ac.uk/).
