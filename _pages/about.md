I'm an assistant professor in the [School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences.htm) at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh. Before Heriot-Watt, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [TU Kaiserslautern](https://arg.cs.uni-kl.de/en/gruppe/najib/), Germany. I hold a [DPhil/PhD from the University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/muhammad.najib/), an MSc from the University of Liverpool, and a BSc from Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology. I also have experience in industry as a R&D software engineer at Samsung Electronics, Indonesia.

**Fully-funded PhD opportunities at Heriot-Watt:** I am accepting PhD students who are interested in working with me in my main research areas. Funding available, covers (international) tuition fees and living expenses. Useful link: [PhD opportunities in Computer Science](https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/schools/mathematical-computer-sciences/research/phd/phd-oportunities-in-computer-science.htm).

Research Interests
======
My current research interests are the combination of three areas: computer science, artificial intelligence, and game theory. I apply formal/mathematical techniques for verifying and reasoning about systems composed of multiple self-interested intelligent agents. In particular, I mainly work on the following topics:

+ Logic and game theory in theoretical computer science and foundations of AI.
+ Verification, design, and synthesis of equilibria in concurrent multi-agent systems.
+ Mathematical/computational logic (e.g., modal and temporal logics).
+ Model checking, automated synthesis, and formal verification.
+ Computational complexity of problems related to topics above.

Part of my work is documented on [http://eve.cs.ox.ac.uk](http://eve.cs.ox.ac.uk/index). I am the main developer of [**EVE** (Equilibrium Verification Environment)](https://github.com/eve-mas/eve-parity/), a tool for [*rational verification*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-021-02658-y). I am always interested in improving EVE (e.g., faster techniques, new use cases, etc.), please do contact me for a potential collaboration.

Supervision Interests
======
I am interested in supervising PhD/MSc/BSc students who want to work on (or related to) topics within my research interests (see Research Interests section above).
