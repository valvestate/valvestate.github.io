EVE (Equilibrium Verification Environment) is a formal verification tool for the automated analysis of temporal equilibrium properties of concurrent and multi-agent systems represented as multi-player games. Systems are modelled using the Simple Reactive Module Language (SRML) as a collection of independent system components (players/agents in a game), which are assumed to have goals expressed using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulae. In particular, EVE checks for the existence of Nash equilibria in such systems and can be used to do rational synthesis and verification automatically.
