Rational verification refers to the problem of checking which
  temporal logic properties hold of a concurrent/multiagent system,
  under the assumption that agents in the system choose strategies
  that form a game theoretic equilibrium. Rational verification can be
  understood as a counterpart to model checking for multiagent
  systems, but while classical model checking can be done in
  polynomial time for some temporal logic specification languages such
  as CTL, and polynomial space with LTL specifications, rational
  verification is much harder: the key decision problems for rational verification
  are 2EXPTIME-complete with LTL specifications,
  even when using explicit-state system representations. Against this
  background, our contributions in this paper are threefold. First, we
  show that the complexity of rational verification can be greatly
  reduced by restricting specifications to GR(1), a fragment of LTL
  that can represent a broad and practically useful class of response
  properties of reactive systems. In particular, we show that for a number of
  relevant settings, rational verification can be done in polynomial
  space and even in polynomial time. Second, we provide improved
  complexity results for rational verification when considering
  players' goals given by mean-payoff utility functions---arguably the
  most widely used approach for quantitative objectives in concurrent and
  multiagent systems. Finally, we consider the problem of computing outcomes that satisfy social
  welfare constraints. To this end, we consider both utilitarian and egalitarian
  social welfare and show that computing such outcomes is either PSPACE-complete or NP-complete.
