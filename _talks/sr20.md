In game theory, *mechanism design* is concerned with the design of
incentives so that a desired outcome of the game can be achieved. In
this paper, we study the design of incentives so that a desirable
equilibrium is obtained, for instance, an equilibrium satisfying a given
temporal logic property---a problem that we call *equilibrium design*.
We base our study on a framework where system specifications are
represented as temporal logic formulae, games as quantitative concurrent
game structures, and players' goals as mean-payoff objectives. In
particular, we consider system specifications given by LTL and GR(1)
formulae, and show that implementing a mechanism to ensure that a given
temporal logic property is satisfied on some/every Nash equilibrium of
the game, whenever such a mechanism exists, can be done in PSPACE for
LTL properties and in NP/$\Sigma^P_2$ for GR(1) specifications. We also
study the complexity of various related decision and optimisation
problems, such as optimality and uniqueness of solutions, and show that
the complexities of all such problems lie within the polynomial
hierarchy. As an application, equilibrium design can be used as an
alternative solution to the rational synthesis and verification problems
for concurrent games with mean-payoff objectives whenever no solution
exists, or as a technique to repair, whenever possible, concurrent games
with undesirable rational outcomes (Nash equilibria) in an optimal way.
