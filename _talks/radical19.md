Verifying equilibria involves checking which temporal logic properties will hold in some
“stable” runs of a system composed of multiple agents which are assumed to behave ratio-
nally and strategically in pursuit of individual objectives. This paradigm is called rational
verification, and can be regarded as a counterpart to (classical) model checking for multi-
agent systems. In this talk, I will propose a practically amenable technique for rational
verification which relies on a reduction to the solution of a collection of parity games. This
approach has been implemented in a tool called EVE. I will also talk about some cases in
which the problem of rational verification is computationally tractable. In particular, it is
possible to reduce the complexity from 2EXPTIME to fixed-parameter tractable. Finally,
I will also introduce a concept called equilibrium design which is concerned in the design
of incentives so that a desirable equilibrium is obtained.
